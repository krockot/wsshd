wsshd is a remote login server over websockets.
The wssh protocol is incomplete and has no formal specification.

Clients connect to ws(s)://host/sh and request a login session.  The server
allocates a new pseudo-terminal and serves a new login process on it.  Data is
transmitted in utf8-encoded JSON message structures.

A Javascript client implementation can be found at https://github.com/krockot/wssh
